    <h1>Wayzen Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 7, 2026</p>

    <p>Wayzen ("we", "our", or "the app") is developed by Wayzen. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our mobile application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we collect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Email address (if signing up with email)</li>
        <li>Name and profile information provided by Google or Apple (if using social sign-in)</li>
        <li>Profile photo (if you choose to upload one)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Location Data</h3>
    <p>Wayzen collects precise location data, including background location, for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Displaying your position on the map</li>
        <li>Recording your routes and tracks during outdoor activities</li>
        <li>Sharing your live location with friends you have explicitly added (Live Share feature)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Background location access is used solely for continuous route recording when the app is not in the foreground. You can stop recording at any time, and location tracking will cease.</p>

    <h3>Camera</h3>
    <p>Camera access is used exclusively to scan QR codes for adding friends within the app. We do not capture or store photos or video.</p>

    <h3>Photo Library</h3>
    <p>Photo library access is used only to allow you to select a profile image. We do not access or scan other photos in your library.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide core app functionality: map display, route recording, and live location sharing</li>
        <li>To authenticate your identity and maintain your account</li>
        <li>To store and display your recorded activity sessions</li>
        <li>To enable social features such as friend connections and live sharing</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using Google Firebase services (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Realtime Database, and Cloud Storage). All data is transmitted over encrypted HTTPS connections. We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>Your data is retained as long as your account is active. You may request deletion of your account and associated data by contacting us at the email address below. Upon account deletion, your personal data will be permanently removed from our servers.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Wayzen uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> — authentication, data storage, and cloud infrastructure</li>
        <li><strong>Google Sign-In / Apple Sign-In</strong> — third-party authentication providers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services have their own privacy policies governing their use of your data.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Wayzen is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected data from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly.</p>
